## Lessons Learned 🌳

While building this project, I learned how to create simple React components. This was my first project using an external API. The Date object in JS was a big challenge for me, but I got to know its methods and sometimes strange behavior for someone new. Working on this project caused me a few problems, but also a lot of satisfaction from solving them.
